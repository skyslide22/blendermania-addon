- Templates for in-game placement (**.Item.xml**)

### One Click Installs:

- Blendermania-dotnet (manipulation of gbx files using gbx.net)

### Export & Converting
- Single **object** or objects in a **collection** as one object
- Multi **scale exports**, create one version and export automatically in different sizes
- Batch/**Parallel**, export all your creations at the same time (collections/objects)
- **Map** export based on existing/linked objects
- Automatic generation of the mandatory **.Meshparams.xml** and **.Item.xml** files
